# React

This project features a full-stack web application for counting different nutrient intakes of a person throughout the day such as calories, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, etc. 

The architechture of the project is as follows:
  1. Frontend: React (with client.js acting as client-side helper for API calls to the backend)
  2. Backend: ExpressJS (Node.js framework)
  3. Database: Flat JSON file

How it works:
  1. React UI sends API requests using helper functions in client.js
  2. Express handles API routes
  3. Data is read from and written to data.json
